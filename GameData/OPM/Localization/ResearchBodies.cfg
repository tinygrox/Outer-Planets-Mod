		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sarnus = Before we knew Jool existed we had always known that there was something greater in the sky. Large and graceful, caretaker of at least as many interesting minor bodies. Now that we have the technology, all is made clear... Sarnus, the timeless.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hale = Hidden in Sarnus' majestic rings we've discovered a very small moon. Since it shepherds the rings around it, we should name it after the mythological shepherd Hale.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ovok = At the outer edge of Sarnus' rings we see a small moon with an unusual shape. It is only fitting that we name it after Ovok, the beast that guarded the gates of the Underworld of the old myths.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Slate = A large moon orbiting Sarnus was spotted on our telescopes. Dark areas are visible on the satellite that remind you of the color of Slate. Yeah, Slate will be a good name for this moon.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tekto = After thinking for some while that there was a booger on the telescope, we realized it was actually a moon orbiting Sarnus.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Eeloo2 = At first it look like this dot was a planet beyond Sarnus' orbit. On closer inspection it turns out to be a moon of Sarnus. Eeloo sounds like a good name for it.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Urlum = For centuries we didn't think there were any more planets out beyond Sarnus. Turns out we were wrong. Naturally we'll name this sky blue dot in the darkness of space after the old deity of the heavens, Urlum.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Polta = We found a moon around Urlum with ice cream-like coloring sort of like Minmus. We think it should be called Polta, after our team's favorite ice cream brand. It's the right thing to do.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Priax = At first we thought we were seeing the moon Polta in two places at once, but it turns out there's a small moon that shares the same orbit as Polta. We'll name this brave little moon after Priax, the hero of legend.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Wal = We've spotted a walnut-shaped moon around Urlum. No-one is feeling very inspired today, so we'll just call it Wal.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tal = We didn't think it was possible, but there seems to be a moon orbiting Wal, which is itself a moon of Urlum. Let's name it Tal, after it's big companion Wal.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Neidon = Mathematicians predicted that there should be another planet beyond Urlum's orbit and we just found it on our telescopes. It's purple like Eve. Maybe name it after Neidon, the companion of the mythological Eve?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Thatmo = We previously thought it to be an UFO, because of its strange retrograde orbit, but it proved to be an actual moon of Neidon. We're quite partial to the name Thatmo.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nissee = After squinting hard at very small dots for what seems like months, we discovered a small moon orbiting Neidon at a considerable distance.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Plock =  That faint brown dot in the sky turns out not to be some star, but an actual planet far, far away from Kerbin. Let's name it Plock, after the mythological deity that guarded the ends of the world.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Karen = The dwarf planet Plock seems to have a moon, but they're dancing around each other like no other pair of bodies in the system. Perhaps we should name this body after the popular dancer Karen Kerman?

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sarnus = Еще до того, как мы узнали о существовании Джула, мы всегда знали, что в небе есть нечто большее. Крупный и изящный, смотритель как минимум за не менее интересными мелкими телами. Теперь, когда у нас есть технология, все прояснилось ... Сарнус, вневременной. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Hale = В величественных кольцах Сарнуса мы обнаружили очень маленькую луну. Поскольку он держит кольца вокруг себя, мы должны назвать его в честь мифологического пастуха Хейла.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ovok = У внешнего края колец Сарнуса мы видим небольшую луну необычной формы. Вполне уместно, что мы назвали его в честь Овока, зверя, охранявшего врата Подземного мира старых мифов. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Slate = В наши телескопы был замечен большой спутник, вращающийся вокруг Сарнуса. На спутнике видны темные области, напоминающие цвет сланца. Да, Слейт (с англ. - сланец) будет хорошим названием для этой луны. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tekto = Подумав некоторое время о том, что в телескоп попала козявка, мы поняли, что на самом деле это была луна, вращающаяся вокруг Сарнуса. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Eeloo2 = Сначала казалось, что эта точка была планетой за орбитой Сарнуса. При ближайшем рассмотрении оказывается, что это спутник Сарнуса. Иилу звучит как хорошее название для этого.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Urlum = На протяжении веков мы не думали, что за пределами Сарнуса есть другие планеты. Оказывается, мы ошибались. Естественно, мы назовем эту небесно-голубую точку в темноте космоса в честь старого божества небес Урлума.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Polta = Мы нашли луну вокруг Урлума с цветом мороженого, вроде Минмуса. Мы думаем, что его следует называть Полта, в честь любимого бренда мороженого нашей команды. Это правильный поступок.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Priax = Сначала мы думали, что видим луну Полта сразу в двух местах, но оказалось, что есть маленькая луна, которая находится на той же орбите, что и Полта. Мы назовем эту отважную маленькую луну в честь Приакса, героя легенды. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Wal = Мы заметили луну в форме ореха вокруг Урлума. Сегодня никто не чувствует особого вдохновения, поэтому назовем его просто Вал.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Tal = Мы не думали, что это возможно, но похоже, что вокруг Уола вращается луна, которая сама по себе является луной Урлума. Назовем его Тал, в честь большого товарища Вал. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Neidon = Математики предсказали, что за орбитой Урлума должна быть другая планета, и мы только что нашли ее с помощью наших телескопов. Он фиолетовый, как Ева. Может быть, назвать его в честь Нейдона, спутника мифологической Евы?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Thatmo = Ранее мы думали, что это НЛО из-за его странной ретроградной орбиты, но оказалось, что это настоящий спутник Нейдона. Мы очень неравнодушны к имени Тэтмо.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Nissee = Прищурившись на очень маленькие точки в течение нескольких месяцев, мы обнаружили маленький спутник, вращающийся вокруг Нейдона на значительном расстоянии. 
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Plock = Эта тусклая коричневая точка в небе оказывается не какой-то звездой, а реальной планетой далеко-далеко от Кербина. Назовем его Плоком в честь мифологического божества, охранявшего край света.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Karen = Кажется, что у карликовой планеты Плоцк есть луна, но они танцуют друг вокруг друга, как никакая другая пара тел в системе. Может, стоит назвать это тело в честь популярной танцовщицы Карен Керман?
