        #LOC_OPM_Sarnus_displayName = Sarnus^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Sarnus_description = Early astronomers believed Sarnus was in fact multiple planets, closely orbiting together. When they cleaned their telescopes, they realized that those extra planets were in fact thin rings orbiting Sarnus. Regular cleaning of telescope lenses became mandatory after that.

        //Urlum
        #LOC_OPM_Urlum_displayName = Urlum^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Urlum_description = It took a while for Kerbal astronomers to realize Urlum was not a far away star, but in fact another planet. Since then scientists have been weary of making claims about Urlum, for fear of being wrong yet again. The ice giant is unusual in that it rotates around its axis in a clockwise fashion, unlike the anti-clockwise rotation of the other planets.

        //Neidon
        #LOC_OPM_Neidon_displayName = Neidon^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Neidon_description = Due to its distance from Kerbin, it wasn't until fairly recently that Kerbalkind discovered the Kerbol system's most distant planet. At first scientists thought Neidon might be a purple, rocky planet like Eve, but they quickly realized they were in fact looking at an ice giant similar to Urlum.

        //Hale
        #LOC_OPM_Hale_displayName = Hale^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Hale_description = This small moonlet orbiting in the rings of Sarnus is named after Hale, a female shepherd from Kerbal mythology who saved the galaxy from certain destruction. Its location in Sarnus' rings results in some of the finest views in the Kerbol system.

        //Ovok
        #LOC_OPM_Ovok_displayName = Ovok^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Ovok_description = Ovok's characteristic smooth egg shape is caused by the tidal force exerted by Sarnus and Ovok's gravity. This has led scientists to believe that the moon must consist of an icy fluff, that easily contracts and expands, resulting in a landscape that is free of deep impact craters. The moon was named for Ovok, a mythological beast known for its soft fur and razor-like claws.

        //Eeloo
        
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Eeloo_description = Discovered at the same time as Plock, the square heads in charge of cataloging the astronomical discoveries mixed up the records of two celestial bodies, leading to years of one being confused for the other. The surface of Eeloo is covered in brown scratches, which could be the result of cryovolcanic activity. This might mean that the moons harbors a liquid ocean beneath its frozen crust.
        
        //Slate
        #LOC_OPM_Slate_displayName = Slate^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Slate_description = Evidence suggests that Slate had an atmosphere only a few million years ago, until an unknown cataclysm stripped the atmosphere away, leaving only a dry husk behind. It's yellow and brown colors have inspired many painters since it's discovery, including the renowned Vincent Van Kerman.

        //Tekto
        #LOC_OPM_Tekto_displayName = Tekto^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Tekto_description = This moon has a very dense atmosphere for a body its size. Combined with the low gravity, this means that a Kerbal with wings attached to his arms could lift off from the surface of the moon under his or her own power. Those wings would have to be made of some sturdy materials though, as Tekto's atmosphere appears to be very violent.

        //Polta
        #LOC_OPM_Polta_displayName = Polta^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Polta_description = Polta's mint-colored appearance immediately reminded astronomers of Minmus, but it was quickly realized that that was still in orbit of Kerbin and this thus had to be another body. Polta's surface is made of smooth and swirling terrain forms, most likely a result of tidal heating caused by the nearby Urlum.

        #LOC_OPM_Priax_displayName = Priax^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Priax_description = Priax shares the orbit of its larger cousin Polta, making it a co-orbital configuration. This strange orbit is stable because Priax is located in the libration point of the larger Polta. Priax is also characterized by its heavily cratered surface, which makes it sort of resemble lump of cheese. Whether the surface is edible has yet to be confirmed.

        //Wal
        #LOC_OPM_Wal_displayName = Wal^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Wal_description = Wal is instantly recognizable due to its walnut-like shape. Its multi-colored surface has led to it winning the title 'Most Beautiful Moon of the Year' two years in a row. Its distinctive equatorial ridge is likely to be caused by the tidal forces created by Wal's moon Tal.

        //Tal
        #LOC_OPM_Tal_displayName = Tal^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Tal_description = Tal is what astronomer's call a sub-satellite. While generally these moons of moons are impossible due to too small spheres of influence, Wal's distant orbit from the ice giant Urlum allowed Tal to maintain a stable orbit. Tal's albedo indicates it is composed of metals, ice or both.
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_DunranaRegionDisplayName = Dunrana Region
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Biome_SigleyRegionDisplayName = Sigley Region
        
        //Thatmo
        #LOC_OPM_Thatmo_displayName = Thatmo^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Thatmo_description = This icy moon was found to have a very thin atmosphere, just thick enough to support aerodynamic flight. It has been the number one destination on every daredevil aviator's bucket list ever since. Oh, and it rotates in the opposite direction around its planet as every other moon. Quite the strange moon indeed.

        #LOC_OPM_Nissee_displayName = Nissee^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Nissee_description = A small moon in a highly inclined and eccentric orbit around Neidon. Its surface looks strangely similar to marble. As a result it has become the envy of every sculptor on Kerbin.

        //Plock
        #LOC_OPM_Plock_displayName = Plock^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Plock_description = There's been a considerable amount of controversy concerning the status of Plock as being a proper planet or just a lump of ice going around the Sun. The debate is still ongoing, as most academic summits held to address the issue have devolved into, on good days, petty name calling, and on worse ones, all-out brawls.

        #LOC_OPM_Karen_displayName = Karen^N
        #LOC_OPM_Planets_Karen_description = Karen is a moon of Plock, but at the same time it also kind of isn't. Due to their relative masses, the two bodies dance around each other in a way that is like no other two bodies in the solar system.

        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_SlateSrfLandedPoles = You take a sample of the "ice". Its texture is brittle with watery attributes. There might have been water here.
        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_SlateSrfLandedSouthernIslands = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin's beaches, but it's less dense and darker in color.
        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_SlateSrfLandedNorthernIslands = The soil reminds you of the sand on Kerbin's beaches, but it's less dense and darker in color.

        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedMountAvaritia = The sample resembles ash, indicating that this place used to have volcanic activity.

        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedRhatIsland = This unusual green soil definitely needs to be investigated thoroughly.
        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedMalebolgePeninsula = You pick up a loose rock off the inclined slope and wonder how far it tumbled down.
        #LOC_OPM_ScienceDefs_SurfaceSample_TektoSrfLandedWitvoogdPeninsula = The sample you picked up mostly consists of multi-colored sand.
